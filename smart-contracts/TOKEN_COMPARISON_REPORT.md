## ❓ **Required Decisions**

**Please confirm your decision on:**

1. ✅ **Token Migration**: Yes/No to migrate to DEX LAXCE
2. 📅 **Timeline**: Preferred migration timeline

## 📞 **Next Steps**

Based on your decision, we will:
- **If Migration**: Prepare migration contracts and communication

**Timeline Impact:**
- **With Migration**: +1 week for migration setup
- **Without Migration**: Immediate DEX deployment but limited features

---

**This decision significantly impacts the DEX's competitive position and long-term success. Given the minimal current adoption (14 holders), migration presents the lowest-risk, highest-reward path forward.**
